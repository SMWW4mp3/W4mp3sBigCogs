## What it adds

### [p]isshit
    [p]cog install W4mp3sBigCogs isshit
**Note:** This command contains some bad language (like some special f-words)
Allows you to wholesomely praise the mentioned user. Why is it called [p]isshit and not [p]praise? Well, this is a small trap for people thinking that they are better than you by using a bot to insult you. Jokes on them, the bot is prasing you and the troll is defeated. Even the description of the command decieves you.  
You can add manually some texts, just open the list.json in the isshit_w4mp3 folder. Use {} as a placeholder for the name.
