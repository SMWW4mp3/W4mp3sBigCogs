  "You're a really nice dude, {}, I appreciate that :)",
  "I love you, {}!",
  "{}, I don't want to be racist but I really appreciate your stuff, keep it up!",
  "What the fuck did you just fucking say {}!? I'll have you know you little shit are top class and you've been involved in pretty nice stuff. You are a cool dude and I really love you. You are nothing like the other ones. I'll praise you like a full human being for accomplishing your goals. You think you can get away with the self-decrepating shit you say to yourself? Think again, fucker. As you read I'm praising you the wholesomest way possible, prepare for the storm, cutie-face. The storm, that wipes out the pathetic self-decrepating shit you said. You're fucking nice, kid. I can support you anytime, anywhere, and I can hug you in over seven hundred ways, and thats only with my cold robboty claws. Not only I am trained in being a nice, obedient robot but also being a caring pal. I'll use my full programming that my creator implemented in me to wipe those shitty ass thoughts out of your head for a little chuckle. If you only knew what wholesome retribution your little 'bad thought' brought. I can't help you more with the text I can post on a Discord server, hang in there kiddo!",
  "Me me big boy. {}, biggest boy, yumyum!",
  "I'm Donald Trump and I approve of this message: {} is a good guy. The best. There is not a better dude than {}. My name is Donald J. Trump, thanks America and this lovely individual.",
  "{}, you loyal, you smart, I appreciate that.",
  "Wow, {}, great moves, keep it up, proud of you!"
